# teensy-race-to-zombie
Project to implement a TeensyPewPew port of the race car game, "Race to Zombie Mountain", which was previously written for a Linux terminal window.

This code was written in my second year of university and was my first time programming a microcontroller. An extensive report detailing the high-level description of the implemented features, as well as a test plan and results.
